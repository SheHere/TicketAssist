# Badges

---
### What do they mean?

Badges are representative of a user's knowledge or experience at the Tech Desk. If a user has knowledge about a specific
system or technology, they would be provided a badge based on this specified knowledge. This will allow other users to
efficiently find other users who have experience in a topic.

### How do you earn them?

To earn badges, a user should learn about a resource or technology and alert an Admin that it may be beneficial to 
display a badge on said user's profile.

### Where do they show up?

A complete list of achievable badges can be found under the badge index page of Ticket Assist 
([link](https://140.209.47.120/badges/badge_index.php)). Badges assigned to each user can be found under the Student
Bios page of Ticket Assist ([link](https://140.209.47.120/StudentRoster/studentbios.php)). Upon hover on the badges of 
a user profile, the names for each badge will be displayed for further clarification.

### How do you modify them?

If a user is an Admin, they will be able to create, modify, or delete badges.

* **Create**: To create a badge, select the purple "Create New Badge" page on the bottom of the badge index page. The 
user will be redirected to the badge manager page where they will select an icon, a name, a prerequisite, and the 
recipients.
    * Icon: This is the icon that will represent the badge and show up on the bottom of the selected users' bios.
    * Name: This is the name of the badge. This will show up on hover of the icon on the bottom of the bio of the user
    that has the badge.
    * Prerequisite: These are the prerequisites for earning a badge. They will only show up on the badge index page and
    should explain how to earn the badge or why a user would receive the badge.
    * Recipients: These are all of the users that will receive the badge being created.
    
* **Modify**: To modify a preexisting badge, select the white "Edit this badge" button on the right side of the row
corresponding to the button the user wishes to modify. Once redirected to the corresponding badge manager page, all 
fields will be populated with the information for the badge. To alter this, just update the fields to the desired
information and select the purple "Update Badge" button on the bottom of the screen.

* **Delete**: To delete a badge, select the red "Delete this badge" button on the right side of the row corresponding 
to the button the user wishes to modify. Once selected, a popup will display asking the user to confirm the deletion.
When selected, this will permanently delete the badge.
