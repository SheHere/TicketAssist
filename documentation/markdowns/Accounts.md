##Types of Accounts  
A Ticket Assist account can have one of four statuses: inactive, student, employee, or alumni.  
###Inactive
Inactive users are those who have requested access, but have not yet been approved. They cannot log in.
###Student
Students are active users, and they will show up in the Student Roster.
###Employee
Employees are active users as well, but they will not be in the Student Roster.
###Alumni
Alumni are Tech Desk students who have graduated. They cannot log in, but they do show up in the Student Roster. 
##Types of Accounts (Continued)
Furthermore, there are three tiers of access: user, superuser, and admin.  
###User
Users have the most basic access, and do are unable to access any links in the Admin Links dropdown in the navbar.  
###Superuser
Superusers are meant to be half-admins, and have permission to:  
- Create and edit guides  
- Create and edit content for the Training section  
- Create and edit employee contacts
- Create and edit Generic Responses

For all of these, there are links that appear on the site only for superusers and admins.  
###Admin
Admins have the most access. In addition to the rights that superusers have, they may:
- Create or remove announcements
- Create, modify, or remove users
- See all user's logs

The bulk of their rights have to do with the modification of users, through the User Roster page.
From there, they can see all users, remove their user image or bio, change their password, or change their permissions / role.
##Account Creation
Accounts can be created in one of two ways:  
    
**Request access from login**  
Anyone can request access from the login page, where they will provide the following information:
- First and last name
- Username (should be St. Thomas username)
- Password

However, they will be unable to log in until they are set as active by an admin. A notification 
will be sent to all admin users to approve the user's access request. The notification will contain 
a link to the User Roster, where the admin must change the user's role to either "Student" or 
"Employee". Accounts with the role "Inactive" will not be allowed to sign in.   

**Account created by admin**    
The second method is to have the account created directly by an admin user. This method will skip the notification 
step, and will allow the user to log in immediately. 
##Account removal
There are two ways to stop a user from accessing the site: setting the user's role to inactive, or deleting the acocunt. 
An innactive user can be re-enabled later and will preserve all of their logs and settings. A deleted account will have
 all references to them removed. Account roles can be changed in the User Roster. Accounts can be deleted at the Add or Remove User page.
##Account Settings
A user can change their account settings at https://140.209.47.120/settings/user/UserSettings.php, where they can modify the following:
- Full name
- Phone number
- Bio
- User picture
- Megalinks
